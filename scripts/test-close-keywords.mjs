// Contract test for the configurable close-keyword vocabulary (issue #75).
//
// `om-close-fixed-issues` used to decide "does this PR close an issue?" from two
// signals that are both English-only: the tracker's `closingIssuesReferences`
// parse and a hard-coded regex. A repository writing `Zamyka #88.` matched
// neither, and the run reported a clean `closed 0` with no warning — the fix is
// the optional `closeKeywords` config key plus a report section for mentions no
// keyword matched. Both halves are cross-file contracts (config schema in
// om-setup-agent-pipeline, consumption in om-close-fixed-issues, the documented
// schema in README), so they are asserted together the way the browser-provider
// contract is.
